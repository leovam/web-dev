    <p style="font-size: 120%; color: red ;">Practicing HTML is fun. <em>So far</em> we have learned
        <strong>HTML</strong> is that help us describe how we want our webpage to look. We have tried the head, title, H (Heading) and paragraph tags so far. Very few people know all the tages in HTML, but that is okay because we can do a lot with just
        some basic tags. We can learn about new tags when we need them</p>
